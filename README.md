<h2>Hi there, I'm Sal  👋</h2>

Interested in the intersection of Art & Technology, all things Android dev.
I majored in Art and Technology studies at The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, 
focusing on the use of technology as an art medium and using the tools of our digital age to illuminate its social, 
political and psychic implications. There is a lot to celebrate and criticize about the digital ecosystem we are all 
living in and becoming increasingly dependent on.
