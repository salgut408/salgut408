# Right brain meets left brain
<h2>Hi there, I'm Sal  👋</h2>

Strategists 👨‍💻 vs. Artists 👨‍🎨. Data scientists 📊 vs. Designers 🎨. Logic vs. Creativity. 
What happens when you combine all these skills to solve a problem?

Artist turned Android developer, creating interesting mobile applications that are intuitive and great UI. <br>
Interested in the intersection of Art & Technology
Always learning, always refactoring :sweat_smile: Feedback drives iteration.

 My favorite tech stack: `Android`, `Kotlin`, `XML`, `MVVM`, `Clean Architecture`, `Coroutines`, `Dagger-Hilt`, `Architecture Components` (`LiveData`, `Lifecycle`, `Room`, `ViewModel`), `Retrofit2`, `Koin`
